               Joshua Raymond had always loved backward Moscow with its scattered, squashed swamps. It was a place where he felt healthy.

               He was a splendid, greedy, port drinker with fluffy fingers and wobbly abs. His friends saw him as a pong, purring patient. Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved a smoggy baby flamingo. That's the sort of man he was.
               <br><br>
               Joshua walked over to the window and reflected on his wild surroundings. The rain hammered like boating koalas.
               <br><br>
               Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Pete Trescothik. Pete was a tight-fisted bear with feathery fingers and spiky abs.

            <p>
               Joshua gulped. He was not prepared for Pete.
               <br><br>
               As Joshua stepped outside and Pete came closer, he could see the jealous glint in his eye.
               <br><br>
               "I am here because I want some more Twitter followers," Pete bellowed, in a remarkable tone. He slammed his fist against Joshua's chest, with the force of 9876 lizards. "I frigging love you, Joshua Raymond."
               <br><br>
               Joshua looked back, even more sleepy and still fingering the giant knife. "Pete, hands up or I'll shoot," he replied.
               <br><br>
               They looked at each other with ecstatic feelings, like two troubled, tall tortoises rampaging at a very helpful funeral, which had drum and bass music playing in the background and two cold-blooded uncles smiling to the beat.
               <br><br>
               Joshua regarded Pete's feathery fingers and spiky abs. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered, gently.
               <br><br>
               "Hmph," pondered Pete.
               <br><br>
               "Please?" begged Joshua with puppy dog eyes.
               <br><br>
            </p>

               Pete looked fuzzy, his body blushing like a troubled, talented teapot.
               <br><br>
               Then Pete came inside for a nice glass of port.
               <br><br>
               THE END
